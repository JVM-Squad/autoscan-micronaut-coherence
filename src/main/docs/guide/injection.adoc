Micronaut, and dependency injection in general, make it easy for application classes to declare the dependencies they need and let the runtime provide them when necessary.
This makes the applications easier to develop, test and reason about, and the code extremely clean.

Micronaut Coherence allows you to do the same for Coherence objects, such as
{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/Session.html[Session],
{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html[NamedMap],
{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/NamedCache.html[NamedCache],
{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/ContinuousQueryCache.html[ContinuousQueryCache],
{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/ConfigurableCacheFactory.html[ConfigurableCacheFactory],
{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/Cluster.html[Cluster], etc...
