The default behaviour of the Coherence Micronaut framework is to use the Coherence bootstrap API introduced in Coherence CE 20.12 to configure and create Coherence instances.
This means that Coherence resources in a Micronaut application are typically owned by a Coherence `Session`.

By default Coherence will start a single Session configured to use the default Coherence configuration file.
This behaviour can easily be configured, in traditional Coherence using system properties, and additionally in Micronaut with Micronaut configuration.
