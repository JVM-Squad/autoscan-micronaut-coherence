For most applications that only use a single `Session` the simple examples above will be all that is required.
Some applications though may use multiple named `Session` instances, in which case the `Session` name need to
be specified.
This can be done by adding the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Name.html[@Name] annotation to the injection point.

[source,java]
----
@Controller
public class MyBean {
    @Inject
    @Name("Catalog")
    private Session session;
----

or into a constructor:
[source,java]
----
@Controller
public class MyBean {
    @Inject
    public MyBean(@Name("Catalog") Session session) {
        // ToDo...
    }
}
----

In both examples above the `Session` injected will be the `Catalog` session.
The named `Session` must have previously been configured when <<bootstrap,bootstrapping Coherence>>.
