If application code only needs to subscribe to messages from a Coherence `NamedTopic` then instead of injecting a
`NamedTopic` bean, a link:{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/topic/Subscriber.html[Subscriber] bean can be injected.

The simplest way to inject a `Subscriber` is just to annotate the injection point of type `Subscriber` with `@Inject`,
for example:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private Subscriber<Order> orders;
----

The example above will inject a `Subscriber` bean, the name of the underlying `NamedTopic` will be taken from the
name of the injection point, in this case `orders`.
