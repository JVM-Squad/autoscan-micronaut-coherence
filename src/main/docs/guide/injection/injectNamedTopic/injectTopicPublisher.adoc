If application code only needs to publish messages to a Coherence `NamedTopic` then instead of injecting a
`NamedTopic` bean, a link:{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/topic/Publisher.html[Publisher] bean can be injected.

The simplest way to inject a `Publisher` is just to annotate the injection point of type `Publisher` with `@Inject`,
for example:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private Publisher<Order> orders;
----

The example above will inject a `Publisher` bean, the name of the underlying `NamedTopic` will be taken from the
name of the injection point, in this case `orders`.
