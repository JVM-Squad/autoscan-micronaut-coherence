If the name of the injection point cannot be used as the `NamedTopic` name, which is always the case with injection points that are method or constructor parameters, then the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Name.html[@Name] annotation can be used to specify the topic name.

For example, both of the code snippets below inject a `Publisher` that published to the `orders` topic:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Name("orders")
private Publisher<Order> orders;
----

[source,java]
----
@Controller
public class OrderController {
    @Inject
    public OrderController(@Name("orders") Publisher<Order> topic) {
        // ToDo:
    }
}
----
