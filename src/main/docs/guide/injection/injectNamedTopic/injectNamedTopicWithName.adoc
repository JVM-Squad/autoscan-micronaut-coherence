Sometimes the name of the topic being injected needs to be different to the injection point name.
This is always the case when injecting into method parameters as the parameter names are lost by the time the injection point is processed. In this case we can use the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Name.html[@Name]
annotation to specify the underlying cache name.

The example below will inject a `NamedTopic` that uses an underlying topic named `orders`.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Name("people")
private NamedTopic<Order> orders;
----

The same applies when injecting a constructor or method parameter:

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class SomeBean {
    @Inject
    public SomeBean(@Name("orders") NamedTopic<Order> topic) {
        // ToDo:
    }
}
----
