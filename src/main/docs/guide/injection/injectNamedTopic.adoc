instances can be injected as beans in Micronaut applications.

The simplest way to inject a `NamedTopic` is to just annotate the injection point with `@javax.inject.Inject`.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private NamedTopic<Person> people;
----

In this example the injection point field name is used to determine the topic name to inject,
so a `NamedTopic` bean with an underlying topic name of `people` will be injected.

As an alternative to using a `NamedTopic` directly in code, Coherence Micronaut also supports annotating methods directly as publishers and subscribers using the same approach as Micronaut Messaging. See the <<messagingWithTopics.adoc,Micronaut Messaging with Coherence Topics>> section of the documentation.
