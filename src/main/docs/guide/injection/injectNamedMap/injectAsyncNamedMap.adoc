It is possible to inject the asynchronous classes link:{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/AsyncNamedMap.html[AsyncNamedMap] and link:{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/net/AsyncNamedCache.html[AsyncNamedCache] as beans in exactly the same way as described above. Just change the type of the injection point to be `AsyncNamedMap` or `AsyncNamedCache`.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Name("people")
private AsyncNamedMap<String, Person> map;
