Using Micronaut to inject Coherence objects into your application classes, and Micronaut beans into Coherence-managed objects will
allow you to support many use cases where dependency injection may be useful, but it doesn't cover an important use
case that is somewhat specific to Coherence.

Coherence is a distributed system, and it uses serialization in order to send both the data and the  processing requests
from one cluster member (or remote client) to another, as well as to store data, both in memory and on disk.

Processing requests, such as entry processors and aggregators, have to be deserialized on a target cluster member(s) in
order to be executed. In some cases, they could benefit from dependency injection in order to avoid service lookups.

Similarly, while the data is stored in a serialized, binary format, it may need to be deserialized into user supplied
classes for server-side processing, such as when executing entry processors and aggregators. In this case, data classes
can often also benefit from dependency injection (in order to support Domain-Driven Design (DDD), for example).

While these transient objects are not managed by the Micronaut container, Coherence Micronaut does support their injection during
deserialization, but for performance reasons requires that you explicitly opt-in by implementing
`com.oracle.coherence.inject.Injectable` interface.
