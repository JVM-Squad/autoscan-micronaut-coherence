By default a `MapEvent` observer method would receive events for all maps/caches.
In practice though, this would not be a very common use case and normally an observer method would be for a specific cache.

The Coherence Micronaut API contains two annotations for specifying the map name link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/MapName.html[@MapName], or cache name link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/CacheName.html[@CacheName].
Both annotations take a single `String` value that is the name of the map or cache that events should be received from.

For example,

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
The above method receives events for _all_ caches.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@MapName("foo")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `foo`.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@CacheName("foo")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the cache named `bar`.
