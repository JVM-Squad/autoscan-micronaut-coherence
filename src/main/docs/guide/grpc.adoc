Coherence can be configured to run a gRPC proxy service that allows suitably configured gRPC clients to
connect to a cluster and use clustered resources such as `NamedMap`, `NamedCache` etc.
The advantage of using a gRPC client rather than a traditional Coherence*Extend client is that the gRPC client is lighter weight than an Extend client and can work better with modern cloud infrastructures, being http/2 as opposed to Coherence custom protocol.

There are two parts required to use Coherence gRPC

* A Coherence cluster running a gRPC proxy

* A client using the gRPC client library

One, or both of these could be using the Coherence Micronaut libraries, for example a Coherence Micronaut application that is a cluster member can be configured to run the gRPC proxy, which can be connected to by non-Micronaut Coherence gRPC clients (or even non-Java Coherence clients such as Coherence JS). And vice-versa, a Micronaut application can be a Coherence Micronaut gRPC client and connect to a non-Micronaut Coherence cluster running a gRPC proxy.

The documentation below covers using gRPC in both cases, the Coherence product documentation covers how to run non-Micronaut gRPC proxies and clients.
